public class Exercise4 {

	/**
	The first step would be comparing the target value (73) to the middle value of 59. Indexes 0-4 are left bounds and 6-9 are right bound.
	Left bound is index 0
	Right bound is index 5
	The middle element would 59
	
	After comparing the target value with the middle value, the target is found to be in the right half of the list, which eliminates the left half of the list. The list now only includes the indexes 6-9.
	Left bound is index 6
	Right bound is index 9
	Middle element is 94
	
	The target value is then compared to the new middle value, 90, and is found to be smaller so indexes 7-9 are eliminated, and 73 becomes the new middle value.
	Left bound index is 6
	Right bound index is 7
	Middle element is 73
	
	After the target is compared to the new middle value, the result becomes “Target found at index 6.”
